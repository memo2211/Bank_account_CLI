# CLI Bank Account Project

This project simulates a simple banking system through a command-line interface (CLI) using Python. It stores account information in dictionaries and provides the following features:

- **Account verification:** Users must enter their card ID and card holder name. The system validates the inputs and allows up to 3 tries for the correct ID.
- **Card expiration check:** The program ensures the card is not expired before allowing any operations.
- **Deposit:** Users can deposit money into their account, with the balance updated immediately.
- **Balance inquiry:** Users can check their current account balance at any time.
- **Transaction (Withdrawal):** Users can withdraw money with a limit of 10,000 per transaction, ensuring the balance is sufficient.
- **Input validation:** The system checks all user inputs to prevent errors or invalid operations.

This project is designed for learning purposes and demonstrates basic Python programming, user input handling, and dictionary usage to manage account data.
